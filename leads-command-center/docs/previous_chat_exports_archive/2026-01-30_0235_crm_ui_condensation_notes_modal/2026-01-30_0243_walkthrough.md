# Walkthrough: Lead Detail Panel Condensation

In Phase 4, we focused on improving the information density and professional feel of the Lead Detail Panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Condensed Layout
The layout now uses a more "Command Center" aesthetic with:
- Reduced padding and tighter vertical spacing.
- Small uppercase section labels (e.g., `LEAD MANAGEMENT`, `CONTACT`, `LOCATION`).
- Consolidated "System Info" section for metadata.

### 2. Header Action Integration
We moved utility actions from the main content body to the header to save space:
- **Copy JSON** (Clipboard icon)
- **Export JSON** (Download icon)
- **Archive/Restore** (Archive/Rotate icons)

### 3. Expandable Notes
The "Add Note" section is now collapsed by default. Clicking the `+ Add Note` button toggles the textarea, keeping the UI clean for leads without current management needs.

### 4. Notes Editor Modal
Long notes are now truncated to 2 lines in the side panel. Clicking any note opens a centered modal for full viewing, editing, and deletion (with confirmation).

## Verification Results
- **CRUD Operations**: Confirmed adding, updating, and deleting notes works as expected.
- **UI Logic**: Verified truncation in side panel and full content display in the modal (centered, dark theme).
- **Safety**: Verified that deleting a note requires explicit confirmation.
- **Standardization**: Confirmed note IDs are handled as strings consistently across the full stack.
