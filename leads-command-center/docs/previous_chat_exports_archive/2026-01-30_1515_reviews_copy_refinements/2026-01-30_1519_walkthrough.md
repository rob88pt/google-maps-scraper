# Walkthrough: Final Review & Layout Refinements

I have finalized the review functionality and panel layout to prioritize the most important information.

## New Features

### 1. Smart Review Sorting (Text-First)
Reviews are now automatically sorted to prioritize quality content:
- **Top**: Reviews with text descriptions.
- **Bottom**: Reviews that only contain a star rating without text.
- This ensures you see meaningful feedback first while still having access to all rating data in both the UI and JSON exports.

### 2. Rating Distribution Chart
A new summary chart has been added to the top of the Reviews section. It provides a visual breakdown of how many 1-5 star reviews the lead has, giving you an instant overview of their reputation.

### 3. Layout Optimization
The **System Info** section (CID, Place ID, Scraped time) has been moved to the very bottom of the panel. This change allows the more actionable data—like contact info, hours, and reviews—to be more prominent and accessible without scrolling as much.

### 4. Technical Consistency
All sorting, deduplication, and filtering rules are applied universally:
- **Table Hover Copy**: Sorted JSON.
- **Side Panel UI**: Sorted list with distribution chart.
- **Bulk Export**: Sorted JSON files.

**Files Modified:**
- [leads-table.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/leads-table.tsx) (Sorting logic)
- [lead-detail-panel.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/lead-detail-panel.tsx) (Sorting + Chart + Layout relocation)
- [route.ts](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/api/export/route.ts) (API parity for sorting)
