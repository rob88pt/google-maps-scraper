# Walkthrough - Leads Dashboard Enhancements

I have successfully implemented Infinite Scroll on the Leads tab and refined the Lead Detail Panel layout for better accessibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infinite Scroll Implementation
- **Data Fetching**: Switched to `@tanstack/react-query`'s `useInfiniteQuery` in `use-leads.ts`, optimizing data retrieval for large datasets.
- **Auto-Loading**: Added an `IntersectionObserver` sentinel to the `LeadsTable` to automatically load the next batch of leads as you scroll.
- **UI Clean-up**: Removed manual pagination buttons, providing more vertical space and a smoother browsing experience.

### 2. Lead Detail Panel Refinement & Condensation
- **Prioritized Actions**: Moved the "Quick Actions" (Copy JSON, Export) to the very top of the scrollable area for instant access.
- **Compact Layout**: Reduced general padding from `p-4` to `p-3` and section spacing from `space-y-6` to `space-y-3`.
- **Cleaner Hierarchy**: Softened dividers (`bg-slate-800/50`) or removed them entirely between sections with distinct backgrounds (Quick Actions, CRM, Reviews).
- **Improved Scannability**: Tightened label and value spacing in Info sections (Contact, Location, Metadata).
- **Persistent Reviews**: Reviews and Metadata are now at the absolute bottom.

### 3. State Management & Reliability
- Ensured that applying filters, search, or sorting correctly resets the infinite scroll session.
- Fixed a regression where the `selectedLead` state was lost during refactoring.

## Verification

The enhancements were verified through browser automation:
- **Infinite Scroll**: Confirmed that scrolling triggers new data loads and the row count increases correctly.
- **Panel Layout**: Verified the new section order (Actions > CRM > Details > Metadata > Reviews).
- **Interactivity**: Confirmed all buttons, filters, and row clicks function as expected.
