# Session Handoff: Laptop/Desktop Responsiveness Planning

Read this file to continue the implementation of the Laptop/Desktop Responsiveness enhancements.

## Project Location
`d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`

## Context Files to Read First
1. `docs/session_handoff/2026-01-27_2120_responsiveness_planning_assets/implementation_plan.md` - The finalized technical plan.
2. `docs/active_context.md` - current state overview.
3. `leads-command-center/src/app/leads/page.tsx` - The main target for layout changes.

## What Was Done This Session
- **Technical Planning**: Finalized a detailed implementation plan for laptop/desktop responsiveness after 4 rounds of review with an AI agent.
- **Decision: Root Layout**: Decided to transition the root layout (`layout.tsx`) to `flex-col h-screen overflow-hidden` to avoid hardcoded height offsets (`h-[calc(100vh-64px)]`).
- **Decision: Overlay**: Decided to add a new `Sheet` component for the `LeadDetailPanel` overlay on screens under 1280px (`xl`).
- **Decision: Column Hiding**: Columns `input_id` and `indicators` will auto-hide on narrow screens by default, but user toggles will persist.
- **Documentation**: Updated `active_context.md`, `changelog.md`, and `task_list.md`.

## What's Left to Do
- [ ] **Step 1**: Implement `useMediaQuery` hook in `leads-command-center/src/lib/hooks/use-media-query.ts`.
- [ ] **Step 2**: Add `Sheet` component to `leads-command-center/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`.
- [ ] **Step 3**: Refactor `leads-command-center/src/app/layout.tsx` for the new flex-column root.
- [ ] **Step 4**: Apply layout and overlay changes to `leads-command-center/src/app/leads/page.tsx` and `leads-command-center/src/app/page.tsx`.
- [ ] **Step 5**: Implement responsive column defaults in `leads-command-center/src/components/leads/leads-table.tsx`.

## How to Verify
```bash
cd d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom\leads-command-center
npm run dev
```
Use the browser tool to check the layout at 1280px, 1366px, and 1440px.

## Suggested First Action
Implement the `use-media-query.ts` hook followed by the `sheet.tsx` component as outlined in the [implementation_plan.md](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/docs/session_handoff/2026-01-27_2120_responsiveness_planning_assets/implementation_plan.md).
