# Google Maps Scraper Monorepo - Session Handoff

## Project
- **Location:** `D:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`

## User's Goal
The user wanted to add a "Website" column to the leads table in the Leads Command Center. This required displaying the `web_site` field from the scraper's output, ensuring it's clickable, truncated for readability, and doesn't interfere with row selection.

## What Was Implemented
- **Website Column**: Directly accessible in the leads table.
- **Improved UX**: 
    - Globe icon indicators.
    - Truncated blue links that open in a new tab.
    - `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent row click panel from opening when clicking a link.
- **Refined Visibility Menu**: Changed technical IDs (e.g., `web_site`, `input_id`) to human-readable labels (e.g., "Website", "Query").

## Remaining Work
- [ ] **Verification**: Confirm that the new column doesn't cause any layout issues with very long company names or on smaller screens (initially verified, but worth keeping an eye on).
- [ ] **System Testing**: Continued end-to-end stability verification from previous backlog.

## How to Run
```bash
cd d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom\leads-command-center
npm run dev
```
