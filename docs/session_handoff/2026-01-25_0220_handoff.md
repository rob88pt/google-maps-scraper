# Session Handoff: UI Enhancements & Session Export

Read this file to continue where the previous session left off.

## Project Location
`d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`

## Context Files to Read First
1. `docs/active_context.md` - current focus and next steps.
2. `docs/task_list.md` - detailed progress tracking.
3. `docs/chat_sessions/2026-01-25_0159_image_preview_implementation/` - archived assets and artifacts for this session.

## What Was Done This Session
- **Implemented Full Screen Image Preview**:
    - Users can now click on business images in the `LeadDetailPanel` to see a full-screen high-quality preview.
    - Uses Radix UI `Dialog` for the overlay.
    - Verified functionality with browser automation.
- **Improved UI Interactivity**:
    - Added hover animations and cursor hints to lead images.
- **Initialized Session History System**:
    - Created the `docs/chat_sessions` architecture.
    - Exported all session assets (screenshots, recordings, and brain artifacts) for history reconstruction.

## What's Left to Do
- [ ] **Wait for User Feedback**: Confirm if the image preview meets the user's needs or if similar functionality is needed for review images.
- [ ] **Review Scraper**: Revisit the "Report this photo" filter if users report broken images again (currently on backlog as user said "images look ok").
- [ ] **System Stability**: Run end-to-end tests for larger datasets.

## Key Decisions Made
- Used **Radix Dialog** for the preview overlay to maintain consistency with the existing shadcn/ui components.
- Opted for `object-contain` in the preview to preserve image aspect ratios regardless of business image dimensions.

## How to Verify Current State
1. Open the Leads app (`http://localhost:3000/leads`).
2. Click any lead with an image.
3. Click the image in the right detail panel.
4. Verify the enlarged preview opens correctly.

## Suggested First Action
Request feedback from the user on the image preview functionality and check if they want to apply this to the "Reviews" image gallery as well.
