# Session Handoff: Authentication & Real-time UI Complete

Read this file to continue where the previous session left off.

## Project Location
`d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`
`d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom\leads-command-center` (Codebase)

## Context Files to Read First
1. `docs/active_context.md` - Current status: Phase 4 & 5 Complete
2. `docs/changelog.md` - Recent additions (Auth, Live Badge, Triggers)
3. `leads-command-center/.env.local` - Verify credentials are set

## What Was Done This Session
- **Authentication**: Implemented full Auth UI (Login, Signup), Middleware protection, and Server Actions.
- **Real-time UI**: Added "LIVE" pulsing badge to Jobs table.
- **Database**: Created Trigger (Migration 004) to auto-increment `result_count` on `results` insert.
- **Verification**: Created `.env.local` for user; build passes.

## What's Left to Do
- [ ] **Manual Verification**: Run a full end-to-end test (signup -> login -> start job -> watch progress).
- [ ] **Next Phase**: Begin polishing the UI or implementing Google OAuth.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Auth Strategy**: Stuck to Email/Password for now (deferred OAuth).
- **Progress Tracking**: Used a database trigger (`004`) for efficient counting instead of expansive queries.
- **Environment**: User must populate `.env.local` manually.

## Gotchas / Watch Out For
- **.env.local**: If this file is empty, the app will fail with "URL and Key are required".
- **Docker Image**: Ensure `google-maps-scraper:custom` image is built locally if moving machines.

## How to Verify Current State
1. **Check Env**: Ensure `leads-command-center/.env.local` has values.
2. **Start App**: `cd leads-command-center && npm run dev`
3. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000` (should redirect to `/login`)
4. **Login/Signup**: Create a user and verify access to dashboard.
