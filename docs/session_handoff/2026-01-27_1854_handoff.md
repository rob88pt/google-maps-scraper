# Session Handoff: Google Maps Scraper Monorepo

Read this file to continue where the previous session left off.

## Project Location
`d:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`

## Context Files to Read First
1. `docs/active_context.md` - current state overview
2. `docs/fork_strategy.md` - **CRITICAL**: Updated to reflect only the active customizations.
3. `docs/changelog.md` - history of changes.

## What Was Done This Session
- **Reverted** unintentional JSON tag additions in `source/gmaps/entry.go`. These were previously added to "fix" PascalCase output, but the user confirmed they are not wanted.
- **Cleaned Up** `docs/fork_strategy.md`. Removed "ghost" requirements that were not actually implemented or were intentionally dropped during the project's earlier consolidation/re-clone.
- **Verified** the three active scraper customizations:
    - **Data Traceability**: Split query logic (`#!#`) in `runner/jobs.go`.
    - **Review Limits**: Integer-based `extra-reviews` flag in `reviews.go`.
    - **Stability**: Nil map panic fix in `reviews.go`.
- **Synchronized Documentation**: Updated `changelog.md`, `active_context.md`, and `task_list.md` to reflect the cleanup.

## Key Decisions Made
- **Code vs Docs Alignment**: Prioritized accuracy of documentation over retaining legacy/ghost requirements.
- **Stability Over Features**: Continued the pattern of keeping the scraper fork lean and stable.

## How to Verify Current State
1. Check [source/gmaps/entry.go](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/source/gmaps/entry.go) to confirm `Review` struct has no JSON tags.
2. Check [docs/fork_strategy.md](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/docs/fork_strategy.md) to see the pruned customization list.
3. The Next.js app is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Suggested First Action
Run a test scraper job with a custom `input_id` (e.g., `test search #!# test_id`) to verify that data traceability is still working correctly without the JSON tags.
