# Session Handoff: Leads Command Center Responsiveness

Read this file to continue where the previous session left off.

## Project Location
`D:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom`

## Context Files to Read First
1. `docs/active_context.md` - current state overview
2. `docs/changelog.md` - detailed list of recent changes
3. `src/app/page.tsx` - Jobs page layout
4. `src/app/leads/page.tsx` - Leads page responsive logic

## What Was Done This Session
- **Global Layout Refactor**: Root layout switched to `flex flex-col h-screen overflow-hidden` to manage internal scrolling and pin the header.
- **Laptop/Desktop Responsiveness**: Implemented a responsive toggle for the Lead Detail panel using `useMediaQuery`. It now uses a sidecar panel on desktop (>1280px) and a Radix-based `Sheet` overlay on smaller screens.
- **Jobs Page Fluid Design**: Fixed the "squeezed" appearance by removing the restrictive grid and allowing the Job Queue card to span the full viewport width.
- **UI Polish**: Resolved a duplicate close button bug in the Lead Detail overlay by adding a conditional `showCloseButton` prop.
- **Table Optimization**: Enforced `table-fixed` and implemented auto-hiding for less critical columns (`input_id`, `indicators`) on narrow viewports.

## What's Left to Do
- [ ] **System Testing**: Verify end-to-end stability for sync and decoupled scraper from DB.
- [ ] **Review Verification**: User mentioned they will test the responsiveness themselves; wait for final feedback.

## Key Decisions Made
- Breaking point for the overlay drawer is set at `1280px` (standard `xl` breakpoint).
- Root overflow is disabled (`overflow-hidden`) to delegate scrolling to specialized `main` or card components, preventing dual scrollbars.

## How to Verify Current State
```bash
cd D:\Websites\GMaps_scraper_gosom\leads-command-center
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/ leads` and resize the window to see the sidecar transition to an overlay drawer.

## Suggested First Action
Verify that the 'Notes' and 'Status' update still works correctly within both the sidecar and the sheet overlay contexts.
