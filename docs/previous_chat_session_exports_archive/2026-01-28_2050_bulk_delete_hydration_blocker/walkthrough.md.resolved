# Walkthrough - Table Layout Persistence

I have implemented layout persistence for the leads table. Your column preferences (width, order, and visibility) will now be saved locally in your browser and restored automatically when you return to the application.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Persistent Column Sizing
Resizing a column by dragging its right edge will now persist that width.
- **Before**: Column widths reset on every page refresh.
- **After**: Custom widths are saved and restored accurately.

### 2. Persistent Column Ordering
Reordering columns via the "Columns" menu or Drag-and-Drop is now saved.
- **Before**: Column order reverted to default on refresh.
- **After**: Your preferred column sequence is maintained across sessions.

### 3. Persistent Column Visibility
Toggling columns on or off in the "Columns" menu is now remembered.
- **Before**: Default visibility was reapplied on every load.
- **After**: Only your chosen columns are displayed.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### useLocalStorage Hook
I created a robust, SSR-safe [useLocalStorage](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/lib/hooks/use-local-storage.ts#5-51) hook that handles synchronization between the application state and the browser's local storage.
- **SSR Safety**: Initial rendering uses default values to match server output, avoiding hydration errors.
- **Dynamic Updates**: State updates are automatically synced to `localStorage`.

### LeadsTable Integration
The [LeadsTable](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/leads-table.tsx#467-739) component was updated to support `columnSizing` persistence and integrates with the [useLocalStorage](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/lib/hooks/use-local-storage.ts#5-51) hook in the main [LeadsPage](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/leads/page.tsx#35-368).

## ✅ Verification Results

### Proof of Persistence
The following recording demonstrates reordering the **Website** column and resizing the **Name** column, followed by a page refresh which maintains the new layout.
