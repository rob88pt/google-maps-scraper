### User Input

Could you also create a prompt that explains what we’re trying to achieve and the problems we’re encountering?

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

I've created a dedicated investigation prompt that clearly outlines our objectives and the specific technical challenges we're facing with the hydration mismatch.

You can find the prompt here: **[hydration_investigation_prompt.md](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/docs/session_handoff/hydration_investigation_prompt.md)**

### What this prompt covers:
- **The Goal**: Finalizing the Bulk Delete feature (which has its API and UI already built).
- **The Problem**: A hydration mismatch on the Leads page that prevents checkboxes from becoming interactive.
- **Key Suspects**: Media query evaluation, local storage initialization, and potential table marking issues.
- **Action plan**: A structured way for the next agent to dive straight into the fix.

This file is also included in the session export folder for archival. All set for the handoff!

### User Input

What is the placeholder file?

### Planner Response

The **placeholder file** is an empty markdown file I created for you to manually save this chat session. 

Since I don't have a way to directly export the text of our conversation into your file system, the standard workflow is for me to create the file and for you to:
1.  **Copy** the contents of this chat session.
2.  **Paste** them into that file to maintain a permanent record of our work, decisions, and logic for future sessions.

The placeholder for this specific session is located here:
**[2026-01-28_2050_bulk_delete_hydration_blocker_chat_session_export.md](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/docs/previous_chat_session_exports_archive/2026-01-28_2050_bulk_delete_hydration_blocker_chat_session_export.md)**

Once you've pasted the chat history there, any future agent will have the full context of this long session!
