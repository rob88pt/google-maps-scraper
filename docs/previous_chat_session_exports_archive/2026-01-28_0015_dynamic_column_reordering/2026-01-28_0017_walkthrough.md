# Walkthrough - Dynamic Column Reordering

I have implemented dynamic column reordering for the Leads table. Users can now reorder columns using both drag-and-drop and a dedicated menu-based interface for accessibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Drag and Drop Interaction
Each reorderable column now features a **grip handle** (GripVertical icon) on the left side of the header. Users can click and drag this handle to move the column to a new position.

### 2. Accessible Menu Reordering
For users who prefer keyboard navigation or more precise control, I added **"Move Up"** and **"Move Down"** buttons to the "Columns" toggle menu. These buttons move columns left and right in the table, respectively.

### 3. State Synchronization
The column order is synchronized across the entire UI. If you drag a column, the "Columns" toggle menu will update its list order automatically. The `columnOrder` state is lifted to the page level to ensure it is preserved during pagination and other view changes.

### 4. Technical Robustness
- **Fixed Columns**: The selection checkbox and the "Actions" menu are fixed and cannot be moved, ensuring UI stability.
- **Conflict Prevention**: Dragging a column correctly prevents row clicks (which open the detail panel) from firing unintentionally.
- **Resize Proof**: Handles are positioned to avoid conflicts with the column resizer hit zone.

## Verification Results

I have verified the implementation with the following tests:
- [x] Dragging a column correctly updates the visual order.
- [x] Reordering via menu buttons updates the table in real-time.
- [x] Column visibility toggling preserves the relative order of columns.
- [x] Sorting and resizing still work as expected.
- [x] Row selection and detail panel opening still work as expected.
