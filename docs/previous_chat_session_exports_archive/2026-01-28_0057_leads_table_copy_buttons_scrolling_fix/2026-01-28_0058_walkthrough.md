# Walkthrough: Table Copy Buttons & Layout Fixes

I have implemented the copy buttons and refined the table layout for better usability and data-density.

## Features
- **Hover Copy Buttons**: subtle buttons appear on hover for **Name**, **Category**, **Query**, and **Location**.
- **Sticky Headers**: Column headers now stay pinned to the top as you scroll vertically.
- **Location Refinement**: Display is now split into a **Semibold Title** (City, State) and a **Subtitle** (Street, Borough, Postal Code).
- **Corrected Scrolling**: Fixed the layout issue where the table would overlap pagination; scrolling is now contained within the table area.
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time `sonner` toasts and icon transitions confirm successful copying.

## Verification
I have verified that both scrolling and sticky headers work perfectly together. The headers stay at the top, and the results no longer bleed into the pagination controls.

## How to Test
1.  Navigate to the **Leads** tab.
2.  **Scroll down**: Notice the headers stay at the top and the pagination buttons stay at the bottom.
3.  **Copy Data**: Hover over any cell in the Name, Category, Query, or Location columns and click the copy icon.
4.  **Verify Location**: Check that the location cell looks cleaner (no redundant city/state in the subtext).
