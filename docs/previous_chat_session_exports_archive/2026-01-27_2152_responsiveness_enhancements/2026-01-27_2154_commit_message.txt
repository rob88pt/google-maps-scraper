feat: implement responsive layout and full-width Jobs page refinement

This commit overhaul the application's layout system to support diverse viewports
and resolves several UI/UX issues related to responsiveness.

Key Changes:
- Global Layout: Refactored `layout.tsx` to a `flex flex-col h-screen overflow-hidden`
  structure. This manages scrolling internally, preventing horizontal overflow
  and keeping the navigation header pinned.
- Responsive Details: Integrated `useMediaQuery` for breakpoint-aware rendering.
  Lead details now transition from a sidecar panel (desktop >1280px) to a
  `Sheet` overlay drawer on smaller screens.
- Jobs Page Optimization: Refactored the "Scraping Jobs" page to be fluid
  and full-width. Removed the restrictive responsive grid that reserved empty
  space on wide monitors, ensuring the content occupies the full available width.
- UI Polish: Resolved a duplicate close button bug where two "X" icons would
  appear in the Lead Detail overlay. Added a `showCloseButton` prop to
  `LeadDetailPanel` for conditional header rendering.
- Leads Table: Enforced `table-fixed` for column stability and implemented
  automatic hiding of 'Query' and 'Indicators' columns on narrower viewports
  to maximize usable space.
