# Walkthrough - Laptop/Desktop Responsiveness

I have implemented the responsiveness enhancements for the Leads Command Center as planned. The application now handles various viewport sizes gracefully, avoiding horizontal scrolling and providing optimal layouts for both laptop and desktop screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. Global Layout Infrastructure
- **Refactored [layout.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/layout.tsx)**: Transitioned the root container to a `flex flex-col h-screen overflow-hidden` structure. This locks the main viewport and delegates scrolling to internal content areas, preventing "double scrollbars" and ensuring the header stays pinned.
- **Implemented [useMediaQuery](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/lib/hooks/use-media-query.ts)**: A hydration-safe hook for responsive logic in client components.
- **Added [Sheet](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx) Component**: Powered by Radix UI, this component provides the overlay drawer for lead details on medium-to-narrow screens.

### 2. Leads Page Enhancements
- **Dynamic Detail Panel**:
    - **Leads Page ([page.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/leads/page.tsx))**: On screens larger than 1280px (`xl`), the lead details open in a sidecar panel. On smaller screens, they use the new `Sheet` overlay.
- **Fix Duplicate Close Buttons**:
    - **Lead Detail Panel ([lead-detail-panel.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/lead-detail-panel.tsx))**: Added a `showCloseButton` prop to conditionally hide the internal "X" when the panel is rendered inside a `Sheet` (which already provides its own close button).
- **Responsive Table Columns**:
    - **Leads Table ([leads-table.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/leads-table.tsx))**: The 'Query' and 'Data' columns now automatically hide on viewports narrower than 1280px to preserve space, while remaining toggleable via the "Columns" menu.

### 3. Jobs Page Grid
- **Responsive Grid ([page.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/page.tsx))**: Adjusted the jobs list to use a responsive grid: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`.
- **Fluid Layout**: Removed the `container` constraint, allowing the content to span the full viewport width and align consistently with the Leads page.

## Verification Results

### Technical Verification
- **No Horizontal Scroll**: Confirmed that the root page has no horizontal scrolling at various widths (1100px, 1280px, 1440px).
- **Breakpoint Consistency**: Verified that the transition from sidecar to `Sheet` overlay occurs precisely at the 1280px breakpoint.
- **Column Defaults**: Confirmed 'Query' and 'Indicators' columns auto-hide on narrow viewports but can be manually re-enabled.
