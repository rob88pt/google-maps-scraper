# Walkthrough: Unified Pagination & Selection

I have resolved the "Dual Buttons" and count discrepancies by consolidating the pagination logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated Controls
- **Before:** Two sets of "Previous" and "Next" buttons. The top set was paged at 10 items (client-side), the bottom set was paged at 25 items (server-side).
- **After:** Only the server-side buttons (25 items per page) remain. This simplifies the UI and makes navigation predictable.

### 2. Accurate Selection Messaging
- **Before:** "0 of 25 row(s) selected" in the footer, which conflicted with the "66 leads found" header.
- **After:** The selection info in the header remains the primary indicator. The footer has been cleaned up to remove redundant and confusing counts.

### 3. Synchronized Paging
- The "Page X of 3" indicator now moves correctly when you click the only remaining navigation buttons.

## Verification

### UI Comparison
- Check [leads-table.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/leads-table.tsx) to confirm the removal of `getPaginationRowModel` and the entire footer block.
- Check [page.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/app/leads/page.tsx) to see how the server-side controls are now the sole owners of navigation.

You should now see a clean, single set of navigation controls at the bottom of the Leads page.
