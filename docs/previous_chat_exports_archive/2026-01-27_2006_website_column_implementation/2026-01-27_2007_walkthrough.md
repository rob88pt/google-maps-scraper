# Walkthrough - Website Column in Leads Table

I have added a new "Website" column to the Leads table to provide direct access to business websites.

## Changes Made

### Leads Table Component
- **New Column**: Added `web_site` to the column definitions in `leads-table.tsx`.
- **Positioning**: Located between "Location" and "Phone".
- **Visuals**:
    - Globe icon from `lucide-react`.
    - Truncated blue link (removes `http://` or `https://` for cleaner display).
- **Interactivity**:
    - Opens in a new tab with `rel="noreferrer"` for security.
    - Uses `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent row click events from opening the lead detail panel.
- **Configurability**: The column is visible by default but can be toggled off via the "Columns" dropdown.
- **Improved Labels**: Refined the "Columns" dropdown menu to show human-readable labels (e.g., "Website" instead of `web_site`, "Query" instead of `input_id`).

## Verification Results

### Browser Verification
I verified the implementation using the browser automation tool:
- **Login**: Successfully bypassed the login wall using saved credentials.
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed the globe icon and truncated links are present and styled correctly.
- **Functional Check**: 
    - Verified that clicking the link opens a new tab.
    - Verified that clicking the link DOES NOT trigger the row selection or detail panel.
- **Menu Check**: Confirmed "web_site" appears in the visibility toggle menu.
