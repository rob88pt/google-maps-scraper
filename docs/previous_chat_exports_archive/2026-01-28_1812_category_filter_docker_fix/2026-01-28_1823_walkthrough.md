# Filter Section Refinement Walkthrough

This task refined the filter section by simplifying labels and removing redundant hint text, creating a cleaner and more professional interface.

## Changes Made

### Filter UI
- **Simplified Labels**: 
    - "Rating Range" → "Star rating"
    - "Reviews Range" → "Number of reviews"
- **Removed Helper text**: Deleted the "Set min/max star rating" and "Set min/max number of reviews" sub-labels to reduce vertical clutter and improve density.
- **Added Star Icon**: Placed a `Star` icon next to the "Star rating" label for visual emphasis.
- **Searchable Categories**: Integrated a search box into the "Filter by Category" dropdown. It features real-time filtering, an automatic query reset when closed, and an "auto-focus" behavior for speed.
- **Accent-Insensitive (Typo-Resistant) Search**: The search algorithm now normalizes strings, allowing matches even if accents are omitted (e.g., typing "cafe" will correctly find the "Café" category).
- **Docker Inactivity Flag Fix**: Implemented automatic normalization for the `-exit-on-inactivity` flag. If a user enters just a number (e.g., `1`), the system now correctly passes it as `1m` to the scraper, preventing Docker startup errors.
- **Resend Job Functionality**: Added "Resend Job" buttons to the Job Queue menu and the Job Configuration dialog. This allows users to quickly clone and rerun any previous job with a single click.
- **Improved Dialog Accessibility**: Added vertical scrolling to the Job Configuration dialog. If the content (queries, parameters, or buttons) exceeds the screen height, a scrollbar will now appear, preventing buttons from being cut off.
- **Global Glass-Style Scrollbars**: The premium, translucent "glass" scrollbar style is now applied globally to every scrollable element in the app (Leads table, Job Queue, Dialogs, etc.), ensuring a high-end, cohesive aesthetic.
- **Improved Focus Handling**: Fixed a focus-loss bug where Radix UI's internal keyboard navigation would steal focus from the search box while typing.

## Verification

The changes were applied to `leads-filters.tsx`. The dev server is running and the UI should reflect these changes immediately.

> [!NOTE]
> The image above shows the previous state. The new state eliminates the small gray text below the labels and updates the headings.

### Functional Check
- [x] "Star rating" label is correct.
- [x] "Number of reviews" label is correct (capitalized "Number").
