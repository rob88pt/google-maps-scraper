# Walkthrough: Enhanced Image Preview Navigation

I have completed the image preview enhancements, including high-resolution loading and full navigation support.

## Final Improvements

### 1. High-Resolution Loading
- The preview dialog now strips thumbnail parameters and appends `=s0` to fetch the image in its maximum original resolution.

### 2. Synchronized Navigation
- Added navigation arrows (previous/next) inside the full-screen dialog.
- The state is synchronized: navigating in the dialog updates the side panel thumbnail, and vice-versa.
- Buttons are styled with a **rectangular background** (rounded corners) to match the existing design language of the side panel.

### 3. Keyboard Support
- Users can now use the physical **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys on their keyboard to cycle through images while the full-screen preview is open.

### 4. UI Consistency
- Preview buttons use a semi-transparent black background (`bg-black/50`) that darkens on hover (`hover:bg-black/70`).
- Icons were enlarged to `10x10` (40px) for better visibility on large displays.

## Verification
- Verified state synchronization between the dialog and the side panel gallery.
- Tested `keydown` event listeners to ensure they are properly cleaned up when the dialog closes.
- Confirmed button styling matches the rectangular request.

## How to Test
1. Select a lead with multiple images.
2. Click the image to open the preview.
3. Use the on-screen arrows or your keyboard's arrow keys to browse.
4. Close the preview and notice the side panel remains synchronized with the last image viewed.
