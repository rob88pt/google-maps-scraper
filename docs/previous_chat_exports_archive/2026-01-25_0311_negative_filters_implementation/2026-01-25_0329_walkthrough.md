# Walkthrough: High-Resolution Image Previews

I have implemented high-resolution image previews in the `LeadDetailPanel`.

## Changes

### 1. URL Transformation Logic
Added a `getHighResUrl` helper function that transforms Google Maps image URLs:
- **Input**: `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...=w400-h300...`
- **Output**: `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...=s0`
The `=s0` parameter tells Google to serve the image in its original/maximum resolution.

### 2. LeadDetailPanel Enhancements
- **Main Image/Gallery**: Images opened in the enlarged dialog now use the high-resolution URL.
- **Thumbnail**: If a lead only has a thumbnail, clicking it now also opens a high-resolution preview.
- **Review Images**: Images within the reviews section are now clickable and open in a high-resolution preview dialog.

## Verification
- Ran TypeScript compilation check (`tsc`) on the project; no errors found in the modified files.
- Verified URL transformation logic with an experimental Node.js script against a real image URL.

## How to Test
1. Go to the Leads page.
2. Select a lead with images.
3. Click the image in the right detail panel to see the full-screen version. It should be crisp and high-resolution.
4. Scroll down to reviews and click any review image to see the high-resolution preview.
