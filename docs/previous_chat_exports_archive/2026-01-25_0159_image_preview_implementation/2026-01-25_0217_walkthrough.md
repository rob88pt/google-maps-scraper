# Walkthrough: Full Screen Image Preview

I have implemented a full-screen image preview feature in the Leads Command Center. This allows users to click on lead images in the side panel to view them in a larger, high-quality overlay.

## Changes Made

### Leads Command Center
#### [lead-detail-panel.tsx](file:///d:/Websites/GMaps_scraper_gosom/leads-command-center/src/components/leads/lead-detail-panel.tsx)
- Integrated the `Dialog` component from `@/components/ui/dialog`.
- Wrapped both the `ImageGallery` (carousel) and the fallback `thumbnail` image with a `DialogTrigger`.
- Added a `DialogContent` that contains the full-sized image with `object-contain` to ensure it fits the screen while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Added a hover effect (`cursor-zoom-in` and scale-up animation) to indicate interactivity.

## Verification Results

### Automated Browser Testing
I verified the functionality using the browser subagent:
1. Navigated to the Leads page.
2. Clicked on a lead to open the detail panel.
3. Clicked the main image.
4. Verified that the `Image Preview` dialog appeared.

### Visual Confirmation
The preview correctly handles different screen sizes and provides a clear close button.
