# Walkthrough: Leads UI Enhancements

I have addressed the scrolling issue and refined the Leads page layout to maximize usable vertical space.

## Changes Made

### 1. Scrolling & Sticky Header
- **Fixed Clipping**: Identified that the Leads table was being clipped by multiple containers with `overflow-hidden`. I updated these to `overflow-auto` where appropriate.
- **Enabled Scroll**: The Leads table now has its own vertical scrollbar.
- **Sticky Header**: The table header (Name, Rating, Location, etc.) now stays fixed at the top while you scroll through leads, ensuring you always know which column is which.

### 2. Header Refinement
- **Removed Redundancy**: Deleted the large, bold "Leads" heading as it was redundant.
- **Repositioned Lead Count**: Moved the "XX leads found" and selection count indicator to the far right of the filter/search bar.

> [!TIP]
> You can now scroll through large lists of leads while keeping the column headers and action buttons (Filters, Export) in view.
