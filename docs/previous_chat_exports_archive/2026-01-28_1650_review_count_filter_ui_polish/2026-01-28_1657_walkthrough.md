# Social Media Icons & Search Enhancement Walkthrough

This task implemented social media icon rendering in the Leads table and extended the search functionality to include website URLs.

## Changes Made

### Leads Table UI
- Added detection for Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter/X URLs in the `web_site` column.
- Replaced the standard globe icon with platform-specific icons (Lucide `Facebook`, `Instagram`, `Twitter`).
- Replaced truncated URLs with human-readable labels like "Facebook Page" or "Instagram Profile" for better scannability.
- Standard websites still display the globe icon and truncated domain name.

### Filter UI Overhaul
- **Prioritized Web Presence**: The Website Type selector (All, Proper Site, Social Only, No Website) is now at the **top** of the filter popover, reflecting its priority for lead generation.
- **Logical Grouping**: Filters are now organized into clear sections with uppercase subtitles and separators:
    1.  **Web Presence** (Highly Priority)
    2.  **Quality & Reviews** (Rating + Review status)
    3.  **Contact Setup** (Email status)
    4.  **Assets** (Photos status)
- **Review Count Range**: Introduced "Min" and "Max" review count inputs, allowing granular filtering of leads based on their social proof.
- **Accessible Side-by-Side Layout**: Optimized horizontal space by placing **Rating Range** and **Reviews Range** side-by-side. Added accessible subtitles (helper text) to guide users and refined the Rating input widths for a professional, symmetric look.
- **"No Reviews" Filter**: Added a new toggle to specifically find leads with 0 reviews, useful for identifying businesses that need reputation management.

### Website Type Filtering
- Supported states:
    - **All**: Shows all results.
    - **Proper Site**: Excludes social media pages, showing only leads with their own domain.
    - **Social Only**: Shows only leads where the primary web presence is Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter/X.
    - **No Website**: Shows leads with no web presence.

### Search Functionality
- Modified `src/app/api/leads/route.ts` to include the `web_site` field in the server-side search logic.
- Users can now search for "facebook", "instagram", or any part of a website URL to filter results.
