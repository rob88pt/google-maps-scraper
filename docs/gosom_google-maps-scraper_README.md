## Quick Start

[Permalink: Quick Start](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#quick-start)

### Web UI

[Permalink: Web UI](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#web-ui)

Start the web interface with a single command:

```
mkdir -p gmapsdata && docker run -v $PWD/gmapsdata:/gmapsdata -p 8080:8080 gosom/google-maps-scraper -data-folder /gmapsdata
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

Or download the [binary release](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper/releases) for your platform.

> **Note:** Results take at least 3 minutes to appear (minimum configured runtime).
>
> **macOS Users:** Docker command may not work. See [MacOS Instructions](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper/blob/main/MacOS%20instructions.md).

### Command Line

[Permalink: Command Line](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#command-line)

```
touch results.csv && docker run \
  -v $PWD/example-queries.txt:/example-queries \
  -v $PWD/results.csv:/results.csv \
  gosom/google-maps-scraper \
  -depth 1 \
  -input /example-queries \
  -results /results.csv \
  -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

> **Tip:** Use `gosom/google-maps-scraper:latest-rod` for the Rod version with faster container startup.

**Want emails?** Add the `-email` flag.

**Want all reviews (up to ~300)?** Add `--extra-reviews` and use `-json` output.

### Using Proxies

[Permalink: Using Proxies](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#using-proxies)

For larger scraping jobs, proxies help avoid rate limiting. Here's how to configure them:

```
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input queries.txt \
  -results results.csv \
  -proxies 'socks5://user:pass@host:port,http://host2:port2' \
  -depth 1 -c 2
```

**Supported protocols:**`socks5`, `socks5h`, `http`, `https`

#### Proxy Providers

[Permalink: Proxy Providers](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#proxy-providers)

If you need reliable proxies, these providers support this project as sponsors:

| Provider | Highlight | Offer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Decodo](https://visit.decodo.com/APVbbx) | #1 response time, 125M+ IPs | [3-day free trial](https://visit.decodo.com/APVbbx) |
| [Evomi](https://evomi.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=gosom-maps) | Swiss quality, 150+ countries | From $0.49/GB |

Using their services helps fund continued development of this scraper.

### Email Extraction

[Permalink: Email Extraction](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#email-extraction)

Email extraction is **disabled by default**. When enabled, the scraper visits each business website to find email addresses.

```
./google-maps-scraper -input queries.txt -results results.csv -email
```

> **Note:** Email extraction increases processing time significantly.

### Fast Mode

[Permalink: Fast Mode](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#fast-mode)

Fast mode returns up to 21 results per query, ordered by distance. Useful for quick data collection with basic fields.

```
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input queries.txt \
  -results results.csv \
  -fast-mode \
  -zoom 15 \
  -radius 5000 \
  -geo '37.7749,-122.4194'
```

> **Warning:** Fast mode is in Beta. You may experience blocking.

* * *

## Advanced Usage

[Permalink: Advanced Usage](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#advanced-usage)

### PostgreSQL Database Provider

[Permalink: PostgreSQL Database Provider](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#postgresql-database-provider)

For distributed scraping across multiple machines:

**1\. Start PostgreSQL:**

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

**2\. Seed the jobs:**

```
./google-maps-scraper \
  -dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" \
  -produce \
  -input example-queries.txt \
  -lang en
```

**3\. Run scrapers (on multiple machines):**

```
./google-maps-scraper \
  -c 2 \
  -depth 1 \
  -dsn "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

[Permalink: Kubernetes Deployment](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#kubernetes-deployment)

```

        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

> **Note:** The headless browser requires significant CPU/memory resources.

### Custom Writer Plugins

[Permalink: Custom Writer Plugins](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#custom-writer-plugins)

Create custom output handlers using Go plugins:

**1\. Write the plugin** (see `examples/plugins/example_writer.go`)

**2\. Build:**

```
go build -buildmode=plugin -tags=plugin -o myplugin.so myplugin.go
```

**3\. Run:**

```
./google-maps-scraper -writer ~/plugins:MyWriter -input queries.txt
```

### Export to LeadsDB

[Permalink: Export to LeadsDB](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#export-to-leadsdb)

Skip the CSV files and send leads directly to a managed database. [LeadsDB](https://getleadsdb.com/) handles deduplication, filtering, and provides an API for your applications.

```
./google-maps-scraper \
  -input queries.txt \
  -leadsdb-api-key "your-api-key" \
  -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

Or via environment variable:

```
export LEADSDB_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./google-maps-scraper -input queries.txt -exit-on-inactivity 3m
```

**Field Mapping**

| Google Maps | LeadsDB |
| --- | --- |
| Title | Name |
| Category | Category |
| Categories | Tags |
| Phone | Phone |
| Website | Website |
| Address | Address, City, State, Country, PostalCode |
| Latitude/Longitude | Coordinates |
| Review Rating | Rating |
| Review Count | ReviewCount |
| Emails | Email |
| Thumbnail | LogoURL |
| CID | SourceID |

Additional fields (Google Maps link, plus code, price range, etc.) are stored as custom attributes.

## Performance

[Permalink: Performance](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper#performance)

**Expected throughput:** ~120 places/minute (with `-c 8 -depth 1`)

| Keywords | Results/Keyword | Total Jobs | Estimated Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 16 | 1,600 | ~13 minutes |
| 1,000 | 16 | 16,000 | ~2.5 hours |
| 10,000 | 16 | 160,000 | ~22 hours |

For large-scale scraping, use the PostgreSQL provider with Kubernetes.
